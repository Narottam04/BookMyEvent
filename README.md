**Test-driven development (TDD)**
Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on creating test cases before fully developing the software. By doing so, it helps to ensure that the software meets the requirements and is tested against all test cases during development.

**Atomic Design**
Atomic design is a user interface design strategy that breaks down the interface into basic, reusable components called atoms. It enables developers to build progressively complex components by combining these atoms into molecules, organisms, templates, and finished pages. The approach helps in developing a consistent, modular design system that is easy to scale and reuse.
